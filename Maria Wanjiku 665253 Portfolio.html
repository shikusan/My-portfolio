        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>
            I was born on the 20th of February 2002, in Nairobi, Kenya. <br>
            I arrived in Italy in March, 2014 with my family.<br> 
            In Kenya, I attended kindergarten and the first half of primary school but had to transfer to Italy.<br>
            In Italy, I started middle school in the second semester of the first year, and spent most of my time 
            learning the Italian and French language.<br> 
            I obtained my middle school certificate with very good marks.<br>
            In high-school, I learned and had a large interest and aptitude 
            in learning and applying new skills i.e., baking, cooking, crafts, translating documents, learning new 
            languages, photography and activism.<br>
            I plan to bring that same mentality with me into my adult life and my career.<br>
            I am a very dedicated to the tasks I am given and always ensure to accomplish them as swiftly and perfectly as I possibly can. 
            I am a team player who is very growth oriented.<br>
